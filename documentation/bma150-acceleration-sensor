Android documentation:

Kernel:
The kernel is registering drivers for a SMB380/BMA150 device.
The driver is accessable through "/dev/bma150".
Newer kernel version would use misc input devices.

Device:
It looks like we have a BMA020. The difference between BMA020 and BMA150:

BMA150 has the ability to measure it's ambient temperature.

Trying to run the ioctl Odys Space is always returning 0.
This would be okay for BMA020, but for BMA150 this translates into -30Â° celsius.

Let us assume it really is a BMA020 using the wrong (newer) kernel driver.
