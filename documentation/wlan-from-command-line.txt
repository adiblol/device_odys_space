# Directory structure and access rights need cleanup
# Not 100% sure what I did. Will have to flash again and write it down
#
# Make sure to add a network definition for your AP to
# wpa_supplicant.conf first and "adb push" it to
# /data/misc/wifi/
#
# And now the magic commands:

sh /system/etc/init.qcom.sdio.sh 1
insmod /system/lib/modules/libra.ko

# Backgrounding the supplicant - use "adb logcat" to see output
wpa_supplicant -Dwext -iwlan0 -c/data/misc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.conf -B

# Optional: Client interface to see scan results (access points)
# wpa_cli -p/data/misc/wifi
# help
# scan_results
# quit

# If wlan0 has been associated with an access point, you can find out with
# iwconfig wlan0

# Start the DHCP client daemon for our interface

dhcpcd -ABKL wlan0 &

# ifconfig should now show an address

ifconfig wlan0

# We should be good to ping hosts on you internal network

ping 192.168.2.3

# Set a valid DNS server

setprop net.dns1 192.168.2.1

# Try something that requires name resolution

ping www.google.com

# New would be a good time to fire up your browser and give it a try
# Ignore (dismiss) the "No network connection" message
# The Google startpage is probably already loading behind the message
